## 🤖 **XGBoost Model Architecture**

### **What is XGBoost?**

**XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** is an advanced machine learning algorithm that:

🎯 **Core Concept:**
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple weak prediction models (decision trees)
- **Gradient Boosting**: Each new tree learns from the errors of previous trees
- **Optimization**: Uses advanced mathematical optimization for better accuracy

🔧 **Why XGBoost for Disease Prediction?**

| Feature | Benefit for Health Prediction |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 🎯 **High Accuracy** | Critical for public health decisions |
| 🚀 **Fast Training** | Quick model updates with new data |
| 📊 **Handles Mixed Data** | Works with numerical + categorical features |
| 🛡️ **Robust to Outliers** | Handles unusual disease spikes |
| 📈 **Feature Importance** | Shows which factors drive outbreaks |
